# Sumatra Project

It's a simple text-only social network written in Ruby on Rails. Highly inspired by [Cyberspace](https://cyberspace.online/). The main features are going to be the same, but also I have some ideas I'm always dream about. 
1. First of all, I want it to be multi-tenant and possible to run multiple spaces on a single instance. It's the way to make many spaces with ease.  
2. Second, the feed shoudn't be the single in a space. While the commutity grows, one feed become more and more overwhelmed. I'd like to have multiple feeds, with different access rules. 
3. Third, I see users and profiles related as multiple-to-multiple, so user can create many profiles and switch between them.
4. Finnaly, the main tragedy of communities is moderation. Over time it should be capable to become self-moderated.

Current stage: the early begining, nothing to show yet, but there's a [changelog](app/views/pages/changelog.md).

The name of the project is random and doesn't mean anything. Could be changed later.
