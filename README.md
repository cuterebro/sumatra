# Sumatra Project

It's a simple text-only social network written in Ruby on Rails. Highly inspired by [Cyberspace](https://cyberspace.online/). The main features are going to be the same, but also I have some ideas I'm always dream about. First of all, I want it to be multi-tenant and possible to run multiple spaces on a single instance. Second, the feed shoun't be the single on an instance. I'd like to have multiple feeds, with different access rules. And the third, I see users and profiles related as multiple-to-multiple, so user can create many profiles and switch between them. That's the basic idea. 

Current stage: the early begining, nothing to show yet, but there's a [changelog](app/views/pages/changelog.md).

The name of the project is random and doesn't mean anything. Could be changed later.
